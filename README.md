## Energy Production
Â   The electricity is generated by Gas and Steam turbines combined in one cycle.
We have to model the energy generated as a function of exhaust vacuum and ambient variables and use that model to improve the plant's performance

### Data Set Details:
This is a project where the variable to be predicted is "energy production" The data file contains 9568 observations with five variables collected from a Combined Cycle Power Plant over six years when power plant was set to work with a full load

#### The Variables or Features
* temperature - in degrees Celsius
* exhaust_vaccum - in cm Hg
* amb_pressure(Ambient Pressure) - in millibar
* r_humidity(Relative humidity) - in percentage
* energy_production - in MW(Million watts) net hourly electrical energy output

### Outliers Detection
* Detected Outliers in Relative Humidity and Ambient Pressure

## Correlation
* Temperature and Exhaust Vaccum are Neatively Correlated
* Ambient Pressure and Relative Humidity are positively Correlated
